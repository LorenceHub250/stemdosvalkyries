        <!-- Article Content -->
        <div class="content">
            <p>That Bohol comes from the word "Bo'ol," which refers to the name of a place (the place thought of as the site of the Sikatuna-Legazpi blood compact) located a few kilometers away from Tagbilaran City is quite well-known. Some sources, however, claim that it actually comes from the Visayan term "boho" (hole) owing to the abundant caves, caverns, and holes in the island.</p>

            <h2>History and Stories of Bohol</h2>
            <p>In "History of Bohol," a doctoral dissertation in history written by Lumin B. Tirol in 1975, Tirol established that the name of the province actually came from "bo'ol," the local name for a kind of tree that used to grow in the province. This claim partly relied on the expert opinion of the Botany Department of the National Museum.</p>
            <p>Beyond its etymology, Bohol is steeped in folktales and legends that reveal the islanders' beliefs, values, and connection to the natural world. One such tale is The Rice Myth, where the goddess Sappia, moved by the suffering of her people during a famine, performed an act of profound sacrifice. She squeezed milk and then blood from her breasts onto weeds, transforming them into the first rice plants, ensuring the survival of her people. This story highlights themes of compassion and resilience.</p>
            
        <img src="picture/boholOrigin2.jpg" alt="Beautiful view of Bohol Island" class="article-image">

            <p>Another popular legend is the Myth on the Origin of Bohol, which narrates the tale of Gawigawen, a giant who, devastated by the tragic loss of his beloved princess Liyang, wept tears that formed the iconic Chocolate Hills. In his grief, Gawigawen also shaped the rivers and valleys of Bohol, leaving a lasting mark on the island’s landscape. This myth intertwines love and loss, illustrating the connection between nature and the emotional lives of Bohol’s people.</p>
            <p>The mystical allure of Bohol extends to its natural sites, as seen in the legend of The Firebird's Tears: The Enchantment of Mainit Hot Spring. According to local lore, the Mainit Hot Spring is imbued with the transformative and healing powers of the Firebird. With its serene surroundings and therapeutic waters, the spring is considered a place of rejuvenation for both body and spirit, making it a cherished site for both locals and visitors alike.</p>
            <p>These tales, passed down through generations, offer a window into the heart of Boholano culture, filled with mythical beings, heroic figures, and timeless lessons. Through these narratives, Bohol’s cultural heritage endures, connecting communities across the island and inspiring a sense of pride and continuity among its people.</p>
